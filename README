I've refactored iplayer-dl in order to make it easier to extend and wrap. As a
direct result, it's no longer just one script. As a result, you'll need to
install the libraries and command-line script in order to use it.

The good news is that this is as easy as typing:

  ruby setup.rb config
  sudo ruby setup.rb install

Windows users should omit 'sudo' in the second line.

You can then run the downloader just by typing:

  iplayer-dl
